<h1>Lua Object-Oriented Programming</h1>

<p>LOOP is a set of modules with functions that help doing object-oriented programming (OOP) in <%=link("Lua")%>.
Much like the <%=link("LuaManual.TableLib")%> module from the <%=link("LuaManual.StdLibs")%> provides functions to manipulate sequences (<i>e.g.</i> insert or remove elements), LOOP modules provide functions to manipulate objects (<i>e.g.</i> get its class) and classes (<i>e.g.</i> define its superclass).
LOOP is based on common solutions adopted by programmers doing OOP in Lua with focus in simplicity and efficiency.</p>

<p>LOOP modules are intended to aid the programmer to perform common tasks using well known solutions for OOP in Lua.
Objects and classes created with LOOP usually interoperate well with other objects and libraries due to this adoption of well known solutions.</p>
